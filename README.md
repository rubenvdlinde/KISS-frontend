# kiss-frontend

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

You will need [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) if you want to run the frontend and the gateway in docker.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

To run the frontend and gateway with docker you need a cmd opened in the root of this project.
Then you will need to pull its image:
```sh
docker-compose pull
```
After that you can run its the image with: 
```sh
docker-compose up
```
If the php container says "Ready to handle connections" you are good to go.

The frontend is run on port: 8080.
The API is run on port :80 and the gateway's admin ui on :8000
More ports that will be used are: :82, :5342

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```
The front-end is run on https in this scenario, on port 3000 (if available).
If you have issues logging in from an incognito window, [have a look at this url](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63587751)
Logging out currently doesn't work on localhost, you can log out by manually deleting the cookie. There's a task on the backlog to fix this.

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
